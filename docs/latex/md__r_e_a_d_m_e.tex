\subsection*{1. Intorduction}

The Gremlins is a memory manager which seeks to prioritize the allocation speed, for that for this purpose we made a class, which basically keeps the free spaces in a linked-\/list for a faster allocation. This project was developed following instructions and orientations given by Prof. Selan Rodrigues dos Santos. By building this, we want to see all the all applications of the subjects studied in E\+DB I.

\subsection*{2. The Algorithms}

We developed all the implementation based on problems described at {\ttfamily projeto\+\_\+gremlins.\+pdf} file. Despite the operation of all methods, we can not apply the test file made by selan.

\subsection*{3. Compilling}

To generation of the documentation type {\ttfamily doxygen config}

To compile this project, you need to\+:

{\ttfamily open your terminal}

{\ttfamily open the directory containing the folder Gremlins}

{\ttfamily make}

\subsection*{4. Running the Tests}

{\ttfamily ./bin/exe}

\subsection*{5. Authorship}

This C++ class was developed by \href{https://github.com/pedrocardoso5}{\tt Pedro Henrique Alves Cardoso} and \href{https://github.com/carvs10}{\tt Jo√£o Victtor Carvalho}
