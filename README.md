## 1. Intorduction

The Gremlins is a memory manager which seeks to prioritize the allocation speed, for that for this purpose
we made a class, which basically keeps the free spaces in a linked-list for a faster allocation.
This project was developed following instructions and orientations given by Prof. Selan Rodrigues dos Santos.
By building this, we want to see all the all applications of the subjects studied in EDB I.

## 2. The Algorithms

We developed all the implementation based on problems described at `projeto_gremlins.pdf` file.
Despite the operation of all methods, we can not apply the test file made by selan.

## 3. Compilling

To compile this project, you need to:

`open your terminal`

`open the directory containing the folder Gremlins`

`make`

## 4. Running the Tests

`./bin/exe`

## 5. Authorship

This C++ class was developed by [Pedro Henrique Alves Cardoso](https://github.com/pedrocardoso5) and [Jo√£o Victtor Carvalho](https://github.com/carvs10)
